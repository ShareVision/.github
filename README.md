### ShareVision's Path in Digital Transformation

ShareVision aims to pave the way in digital transformation. We develop diverse solutions for artificial intelligence and speech recognition. Specifically, we have developed drone software that automatically detects damage to pipelines and power poles. This addresses the problem of days-long work for technicians by providing efficient inspection and delivering real-time data.

A promising future field for ShareVision is Cognitive Services. Speech and facial recognition are meaningful applications and provide significant assistance.
